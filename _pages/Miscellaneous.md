I love the nature and enjoy the outdoors, by hiking, birding, and radio orienteering.

#### Birding 

I became a birder in 2021, during Covid lockdown. Watching the lively birds jumping, playing, and flying shed light into my life. I have been birding locally and around the US. Checkout my [footprint](https://ebird.org/profile/MTc0MjQ3Mg).

#### Radio orienteering 
Radio orienteering, also called [amateur radio direction finding (ARDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding), and [orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering) are my favorite sports. These two sports are closely related but differs in equipment. In orienteering, one uses a map and compass in cross country running to find control points whose exact locations are given on the map. In radio orienteering, however, one uses a map that does not show locations of the control points, and instead uses a radio receiver to search for hidden radio transmitters (these are the control points). Check out [Backwoods Orienteering Klub](https://backwoodsok.org/) and [Homingin](http://www.homingin.com/farsnews.html) to see what ARDF activists are doing in the US.
