I love the nature and enjoy the outdoors, by hiking, birding, and radio orienteering.

I became a birder in 2021, during Covid lockdown. Watching the lively birds jumping, playing, and flying shed light into my life. I have been birding locally and around the US. Checkout my [footprint](https://ebird.org/profile/MTc0MjQ3Mg).
